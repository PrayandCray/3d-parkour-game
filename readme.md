**THE PARKOUR GAME**

This is my 1st time playing around with godot 3d and I want to turn this experiment into a working game that looks good, so keep up if you want to see more!

I've been coding in godot for around 1 year now and have always wanted to make a 3d game but it always felt out of reach, so i decided that with Hack Club's Summer of Making coming along the way I should give it a shot for fun.
